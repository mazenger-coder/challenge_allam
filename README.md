# Readme for the Site_Capacity.py

The goal of this Python script is to write a function that reads certain values from an Excel file and calculates the sum. The script expects 3 inputs from the user. On the one hand the skill on the other hand the year and month. In this script the user is asked to enter the desired skill at the beginning. Then the desired year and then the month. The desired data is then read and the sum is calculated.

At the beginning the user is asked to enter the desired skill: 
	
	__Please enter the skill:__

Then the user has to make an entry and press enter 
	 
	*User : DD*

After this has been done, the user is asked again to make an entry but this time the desired year:
	
	__~Please enter the year:__

Then the user has to make an entry and press enter. This time the input must not be a string, it can only be an integer.

	__Please enter the month:__

Then the user has to make an entry and press enter.
